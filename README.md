# UK Process Mapping (Leaky Bucket)

1. Identify user roles and Departments
1. Determine departmental Processes
1. Determine objects Required
1. Determine attributes required for each object
1. Map dependency for attributes at stages

## To Do

- Speak with Gareth - He might have information on the updated sales process

## Biggest Issues

1. Variations
1. Approvals
1. Handover from Sales to Operations
   1. Scope of Works not being provided with the order
   1. Client not signing PO against scope
   1. Returning to scenario where revisions are done immediately after sale
1. New User Setup

## Conversation with Lisa

- Box Sales
  - Working alright
  - Handled by Lexie
  - Lexie acts as a project manager for the box sale so it flows exactly the same way as a project minus the integration
- Variations
  - big issue
  - Speak with Gareth and Mims
  - Massively time consuming, holds up projects and returns
  - Creates a massive risk
  - Technical changes are going through design engineering
    - ??? What are the design engineers priorities
  - Approval process?
