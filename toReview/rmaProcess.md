RMA PROCESS - RETURNS FAULTY / DOA WORK INSTRUCTIONS
This document details the process that will be following in the event of a product failure during witness test, rack assembly, site installation, or commissioning.
Please note - All correspondence linked to RMA’s as detailed must go via ukrma@avispl.com
1.0 RAISING AN RMA REQUEST
1.0.0 The originator (person who notices the issue) completes the Returns Template (AVI-OPS-RMAF01) – the areas marked in blue on the ‘Returns note’ tab.

• Supplier details - if you do not know the address please add the vendor i.e. Crestron
• Date – date of the issue being found
• Returns number – leave blank (procurement to complete)
• AVI-SPL order no. – complete the relevant PO number
• Supplier reference – leave blank (procurement will add the vendor RMA reference)
• AVI-SPL Contact Name – this is the originators name
• AVI-SPL Internal Ref / Job – this will be the project number and name description
• Qty – quantity of the item(s)
• Item – Model / part number
• Serial No. – Units serial number or NA if part is not serialised
• Reason – description of fault, does not work is not acceptable, we / the supplier needs more detail i.e. unit is powered but will come out of standby.

Please note - One form is to be completed for each manufacturer.

1.0.1 Once completed, the form needs to be forwarded with any additional relevant information (i.e. photos) to ukrma@avispl.com
1.0.2 Please do not engage with the vendor directly unless you are trying to establish a fault; or are talking to their technical department to avoid sending the unit back. Some products have hidden menus and issues can be resolved over the phone.
Only engage with vendors directly if you have approval from either the Procurement Director or Operations Director. This is required to ensure:
• We have visibility of the RMA
• If the goods turn up at the warehouse need to know what to do with them
• If the goods turn up at the site and have the originators name only as reference, they could be rejected as you are not on the staff list
• The clock is ticking with advance replacements once issued.
• If the original part is not returned within a short period of time an invoice is generated.
This will result in the project buying the item twice
Please do not presume the client will process the RMA and return the hardware – We are fully responsible for this

1.0.3 The faulty unit needs to be sent back to Farnborough warehouse as quick as possible to avoid delays in repairs and/ or issues with finance and invoices. The timeframe for the return of the faulty goods is two working days.
The physical unit(s) need to be back in the warehouse before the process can begin; if you work with the RMA team for items that could fall outside of agreed timeframes as identified. The team will work with the originator when and where possible to meet the end customer’s requirements / needs we can make / agree on the timelines.
The responsibility is with the originator until the hardware is returned.
1.1 PROCESSING AN RMA REQUEST
1.1.0 Once the RMA form is received by the RMA team the information will be verified, return number and supplier reference added and recorded on the returns log.
The completed form is then issued to the warehouse who will box and package for shipment to the vendor.
Two copies of the shipping tab are printed. One will be attached to the box, the other will be updated by hand detailing the method used to ship (i.e. R12345 FedEx ref 5678910 21/05/2020.)
This is passed back to the RMA team who will record, track, trace and chase the outstanding RMA.
1.1.1 In the case of a repair, the originator will be contacted upon return and arrangements made to return the item to site – internal shipping request will be required.
1.2 CREDIT FOR RMA GOODS
1.2.0 The goods must be in their original box, all contents in that box, unused, ideally still sealed and returned to the warehouse within two working days of being identified as surplus to requirements.
Any goods that do not fall into the above category have the option of RMA for credit, but there a very slim chance of acceptance and subject to high re-stocking costs.
If a unit is taken out of a box and has damage, please take a photo, and put it back in its box – Please do not reuse the unit.
1.2.1 In the case of a credit, the original PO is updated upon receipt of the credit note, the value added and credited to the job is as per credit note value include any re-stocking fee.
1.2.2 The RMA team will log expected credits and RMAs on PO’s.
1.2.3 The RMA team will provide a weekly update detailing the open RMA’s logged. The standard timeline for closing down a repair RMA is four weeks.
1.2.4 The typical timeframe for a credit on an RMA’s is four to six weeks from the date of shipment of goods back to the vendor.
