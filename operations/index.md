## Focus Areas

- Low Level Design
  - Desk Engineering
  - Detailed Scope of Works (Low Level Design)
    - out designs are too high level and missing client expectations when operations get to the point of delivery
    - Lead to margin erosion as client can negotiate on price with sales (free labour and hardware)
- RFP Delivered Projects
  - Pause design it it changes
  - Large percentage of projects won, change dramatically from initial scope
  - Amazon was a success, as they had standard room designs
  - Variations are always part of integration and good for us to gain more margin
  - We are redesigning on the fly, haemorrhage time and money
  - All RFPs have 10+ variations
  - Highest variations on a project is 134
- Variation Process
  - Ownership of variations isn't clear
  - 10 process steps with 4 pinch points
  - restocking fees apply on returned hardware as we can't return after 30 days
  - 8 teams (2 departments) includes in the process
